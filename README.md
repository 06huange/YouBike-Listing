# YouBike Listing

The website lists YouBike service areas and the status of each area (total bikes, available bikes etc). Google Maps api is then used to display the precise location of the bike renting station along with the number of bikes currently available. React framework is used for dynamic changes to dom tree, resulting in a more responsive experience.

Local-Cors-Proxy library is used to create proxy for receiving data from api when developing locally.

Instructions:

1. ```npm install``` to install required dependencies
2. ```npm run proxy``` to start local proxy server (for local development)
3. ```npm start``` to run react app locally
